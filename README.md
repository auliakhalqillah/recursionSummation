# Recursion Method
The simple code of summation process by using recursion method
# Algorithm
You can finde the description of this algorithm on [Iteration and Recursion Function in Python](https://sharing.auliakhalqillah.com/2020/04/11/iteration-and-recursion-function-in-python/)
# The advantages of recursion method
1. Reduces the length of program,
2. The code is clean and elegant
3. Generating sequence is easier than using nested iteration.
# The disadvantages of recursion method
1. Hard to understand,
2. Difficult to trace and bug,
3. Some cases, recursion requires extra memory but it take  a short time to process.
